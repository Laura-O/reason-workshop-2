## 1. Data structures

Create a data-structure for a chess figure with the following attributes: color, position, kind

- The color can be either black / white
- The position has 2 dimensions on a typical chess board
- The kind describes the value of the figure (king, tower, pawn â€¦)

Put your data-structures in action by storing 2 chess figures in a collection called figures:

- Figure 1: Black, King, on position A1
- Figure 2: White, Tower, on position C7

I recommend to use the playground for this example: https://reasonml.github.io/en/try

Alternative playground: https://sketch.sh/

Tip: You may use lists, arrays, tuples, variants for these tasks

## 2. Data structures II

Create a file Data.re and inside create a list of places with the following properties

- id (generate uuids via https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)
- name
- description
- image containing an url, attribution and attributionUrl (optional)
- address
- phone (optional)
- email (optional)
- coordinates containing lat and lng

## 3. Manipulate Data

1. Create an Array of names based on the places data structure. Print out the array for verification.

Try it without and then use fast-pipe for this task.

2. Pro lesson: create a search funtion. You can give it a string and it will find items based on the place name. For an empty string it returns all entries. Note: There is String and Js.String when using BuckleScript
